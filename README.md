# OnBoard

OnBoard is meant to steamline local government. 
A basic responsibility of a local government is to create and fill boards and commissions. 
The local government should be able to spend their time meeting citizens and appointing them, 
not administering the actual process. 
That is where OnBoard comes in and makes administering your boards and commissions simple.

Features of OnBoard:
* Public view of all board and commission members and their terms.
* Private page to input a new board or commission application (will eventually be a public page!).
* Private view of all applicants across all boards and commissions.
* Private view of applicants by board or commission.

Future enhancements of OnBoard:
* Public application for residents to use available online 24/7.
* Confirmation of citizen user via email to ensure the person is who they say they are.
* A way for admins to archive applications when a resident moves out of the community 
or is otherwise unable to serve.
* A one-year follow up so that no application becomes stale.
